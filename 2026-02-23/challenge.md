Given a donor blood type and a recipient blood type, determine whether the donor can give blood to the recipient.

Each blood type consists of:

A letter: "A", "B", "AB", or "O"
And an Rh factor: "+" or "-"
Blood types will be one of the valid letters followed by an Rh factor. For example, "AB+" and "O-" are valid blood types.

Letter Rules:

"O" can donate to other letter type.
"A" can donate to "A" and "AB".
"B" can donate to "B" and "AB".
"AB" can donate only to "AB".

Rh Rules:

Negative ("-") can donate to both "-" and "+".
Positive ("+") can donate only to "+".
Both letter and Rh rule must pass for a donor to be able to donate to the recipient.

Tests
1. canDonate("B+", "B+") should return true.
2. canDonate("O-", "AB-") should return true.
3. canDonate("O+", "A-") should return false.
4. canDonate("A+", "AB+") should return true.
5. canDonate("A-", "B-") should return false.
6. canDonate("B-", "AB+") should return true.
7. canDonate("B-", "A+") should return false.
8. canDonate("O-", "O+") should return true.
9. canDonate("O+", "O-") should return false.
10. canDonate("AB+", "AB-") should return false.
