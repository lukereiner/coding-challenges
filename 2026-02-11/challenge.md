2026 Winter Games Day 6: Figure Skating
Given an array of judge scores and optional penalties, calculate the final score for a figure skating routine.

The first argument is an array of 10 judge scores, each a number from 0 to 10. Remove the highest and lowest judge scores and sum the remaining 8 scores to get the base score.

Any additional arguments passed to the function are penalties. Subtract all penalties from the base score to get the final score.

Tests
1. computeScore([10, 8, 9, 6, 9, 8, 8, 9, 7, 7], 1) should return 64.
2. computeScore([10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]) should return 80.
3. computeScore([10, 8, 9, 10, 9, 8, 8, 9, 10, 7], 1, 2, 1) should return 67.
4. computeScore([8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 8.5, 9.0, 8.0, 9.0, 8.5, 9.0, 8.5], 0.5, 1.0) should return 67.5.
5. computeScore([6.0, 8.5, 7.0, 9.0, 7.5, 8.0, 6.5, 9.5, 7.0, 8.0], 1.5, 0.5, 0.5) should return 59.
