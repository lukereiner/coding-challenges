Given a string, return a message with the count of how many letters and numbers it contains.

Letters are A-Z and a-z.
Numbers are 0-9.
Ignore all other characters.

Return "The string has X letters and Y numbers.", where "X" is the count of letters and "Y" is the count of numbers. If either count is 1, use the singular form for that item. E.g: "1 letter" instead of "1 letters" and "1 number" instead of "1 numbers".
