Given an array of playing cards, return a new array with the numeric value of each card.

Card Values:
- An Ace ("A") has a value of 1.
- Numbered cards ("2" - "10") have their face value: 2 - 10, respectively.
- Face cards: Jack ("J"), Queen ("Q"), and King ("K") are each worth 10.

Suits:
- Each card has a suit: Spades ("S"), Clubs ("C"), Diamonds ("D"), or Hearts ("H").

Card Format:
- Each card is represented as a string: "valueSuit". For Example: "AS" is the Ace of Spades, "10H" is the Ten of Hearts, and "QC" is the Queen of Clubs.
