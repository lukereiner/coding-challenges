Given a string representing the curves on a skeleton track, determine the difficulty of the track.

The given string will only consist of the letters:

"L" for a left turn
"R" for a right turn
"S" for a straight segment

Each direction change adds 15 points (an "L" followed by an "R" or vice versa).

All other curves add 5 points each (all other "L" or "R" characters).

Straight segments add 0 points.

The difficulty of the track is based on the total score. Return:

"Easy" if the total is 0 - 100
"Medium" if the total is 101-200
"Hard" if the total is over 200

Tests
1. getDifficulty("SLSLLSRRLSRLRL") should return "Easy".
2. getDifficulty("LLRSLRLRSLLRLRSLRRLRSRLLS") should return "Hard".
3. getDifficulty("SRRRRLSLLRLRSSRLSRL") should return "Medium".
4. getDifficulty("LSRLRLSRLRLSLRSLRLLRLSRLRLRSL") should return "Hard".
5. getDifficulty("SLLSSLRLSLSLRSLSSLRL") should return "Medium".
6. getDifficulty("SRSLSRSLSRRSLSRSRSLSRLSRSR") should return "Easy".
